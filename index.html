	<h1><b>NOTES - PROJECT 0</b><br></h1>
	<div class="Session1">
		<div>
			In this lesson I learned about basics of <em>HTML</em> & what are components required to build HTML page. So below are my notes.
		</div>

		<div>
			<p>
				I will start with example, what parts are invloved when we access certain webpage.It consist of,<br>
				<b><em>Server</em></b> - Its a computer which host website. Website is made from HTML language. It contains images, notes, audio or video, etc.<br>
				<b><em>PC</em></b> - Its a computer from where client access website, by using application like IE, Firefox, Chrome.<br>
				<b><em>HTML</em></b> - Its protocol which talks between client & server, so that webpage could be viewed by client in IE, Firefox.<br>
				<b><em>Internet</em></b> - Its final and important part of all, it connects two machine like PC & Server. So that they could talk to each other.<br>

			<h2>BASICS OF HTML<br></h2>
			<div>
				Webpage is constructed using HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language. Contents of webpage such as docuement, image, audio or video
				is accessed through HTML. Fundamental building blocks are as follow,<br><br>

				<b>TAGS</b> - Tags are used to format contents in HTML page. Format of specifying any tag is <em>< NAME > Content < /NAME ></em>(dont' consider white spaces, during code writing) where Name is Tag name, Content is any normal content or it could other tag as well. First Name is called opening tag and other one is closing tag.<br>

				<b>ELEMENTS</b>- It is composed of opening tag, content & closing tag. There are two types of it Inline & Block.<br><br>
			</div>

			<div>
				Lets discuss some of tags -<br>
				1] To make any content bold, we use b tag. For Example <b>UDACITY NANODEGREE</b><br>
				2] To make italics, we use em tag. For Example <em>UDACITY NANODEGREE</em><br>
				3] To give line break, we use br tag. This tag is called void tag because there is no closing tag means no contents.<br>
				4] To insert link for other webpage, we use anchor tag. For Example <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/nd000">UDACITY NANODEGREE</a><br>

	<h1>NOTES - PROJECT 1</h1>
	<div class="Session2">

		<div>
			In this section, discussing about structure of HTML document and how web browser interprets that structure. Then how to enhance HTML webpage using other languages like CSS, etc.
		</div>

		<div>
			<p>
				To better understand, take an analogy of house as a webpage. In it HTML will be like walls, kitchens, it will tell where is your kitchen, living room etc. Then CSS will add style to like coloring your walls, and other items which makes home look good.
			</p>
			<p>
				For better and quicker understanding of HTML page structure; let's consider popular website <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>. When opened in web browser <em>Google Chrome</em>, using Developer tool will show structure of webpage. Its called <b><em>DOM</em></b> abbrevation for Document object model. It's also called <b>"Tree Structure"</b>, representation in hierarchical structure of web page.
			</p>
		</div>	

		<span><h3>BOX!!</h3></span>

		<div>
			<p>
				From above observation of <b>Wikipedia</b>, webpage structure made of boxes, big boxes, small boxes within it. Thats how HTML page is constructed. Advantage of doing it that way, we can formal particular section as per our need, move it to other location easily without working on each element in that box. It saves lot of time. This is done by using HTML tag <b>DIV</b>.<br>
				There are several advantages of these boxes. When you have design along with some text material and you have fit that into webpage; boxes helps lot. Cut down page into separate big boxes, then further cutting down those individual boxes into another small boxes as per requirement, for example if have images in it.

	<div>
		<span><h3>SUMMARY</h3></span>
			<p>
				In starting we discussed how internet works, webpages are made using HTML. Two HTML's main components, TAGs & Elements. Later session covered how HTML, CSS, etc comes together and adds more features to webpage. Using developer tools in browser we can view DOM (Document Object Model) also called Tree Structure. Finally Boxes and how HTML pages is divided into boxes.
